        <h2>Understanding Dyslexia</h2>
          <p>
            Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects the brain's ability to process written language. People with dyslexia often face challenges in reading, writing, and spelling. These difficulties stem from how the brain interprets and organizes language-related information, not from a lack of intelligence or desire to learn. Dyslexia is one of the most common learning differences, affecting approximately 10-15% of the population, with individuals experiencing a spectrum of challenges.
          </p>
          <h3>Common Challenges Faced by People with Dyslexia</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reading Fluency:</strong> Difficulty in recognizing and reading words quickly and accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Decoding Text:</strong> Trouble translating written words into sounds, impacting comprehension.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Retention:</strong> Challenges in retaining sequences, patterns, and recalling specific information.</li>
            <li><strong>Spelling and Writing:</strong> Frequent misspelling and inconsistent spelling of common words.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Distortions:</strong> Experiencing issues such as letters appearing to shift, blur, or "jump" on the page.</li>
          </ul>
